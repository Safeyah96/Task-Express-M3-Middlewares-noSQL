    title: "Avatar",
    body: "Soon after hitting theaters in 2009, Avatar became one of the highest grossing movies of all time. Using the newly invented (at that time) motion capture technique, 3-D viewing and the use of stereoscopic filmmaking, it’s no surprise that the film won an Academy Award, in addition to several other awards for its visual effects. This film is available with audio description, and we highly suggest you take the time to listen to it!",

    title: "Avengers: Infinity War",
    body: "With an estimated budget of $300 – $400 million, Marvel’s Infinity War is one of the most expensive movies ever created. Wondering why it cost so much? Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but those elaborate costumes and scenery were actually created digitally. It took 13 visual effects companies to create the incredibly detailed characters and scenes in this movie. Missing out on the astonishing visual effects in this movie is not only missing a huge part of what’s happening, but also missing out on brilliant works of art. The comparisons below show you what it actually looked like when filming, compared with what it looks like on screen. In many scenes, the footage was shot with green screens and minimal costuming, only to be digitally created later on.",

    title: "Star Wars: The Force Awakens",
    body: "For any Star Wars fans, I probably don’t have to give you reasons why this is a movie to watch with audio description (and in any other format you can think of, for that matter.) But if you’re looking for another reason, consider the visuals.The Star Wars opening crawl is the signature of every Star Wars movie, and has become an iconic symbol that even non Star Wars fans recognize. The opening crawl begins with the static blue text, “A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away….”. None of the text is spoken out loud, so for those with vision loss, this iconic on-screen text which provides crucial information to viewers is missed if it is not audio described",
